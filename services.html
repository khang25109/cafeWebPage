            <p class="text">Candy is made by dissolving sugar in water or milk to form a syrup, which is boiled until it reaches the desired concentration or starts to caramelize.
               Candy comes in a wide variety of textures, from soft and chewy to hard and brittle.
               The texture of candy depends on the ingredients.</p>

            <h2>Clients About Us</h2>
            <p class="text">The holidays with my family would have been 
              totally different and even boring if it wasn't 
              for your amazing desserts. Candies, cupcakes, 
              macarons were simply unforgettable! 
              The sweets are the best, especially with the great service and at affordable price. Thanks!</p>
